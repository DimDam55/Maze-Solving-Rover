# Maze-Solving-Rover
## Maze Solving Rover using Arduino Uno

Created by: Damianos Dimitrios, Larisis Konstantinos

Duration: October-November 2022

This is our submission for the 2022 Workshop of NTUA Microprocessors Laboratory & Digital Systems Laboratory (MICROLAB)

## Possible applications of a maze solving rover

- Detection of victims trapped under collapsed buildings
- Exploration of inaccessibe areas (e.g. caves)

## The implementation

Our rover uses the [Left Wall Follower algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze-solving_algorithm) to find the exit from the maze, given that the rover begins at its entrance.
